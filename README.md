# Dicee ðŸŽ²

## Goal

The objective of this repository is to introduce us to the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps we will build in the future. This app will teach you how to make apps with functionality using setState() inside Stateful Flutter widgets.


## What is this project

I created a Las Vegas dice app. You can make the die roll at the press of a button. With this app in your pocket, youâ€™ll be able to settle any score on the go!
